# Alternatives to “/” in Unicode [1.1]

We can use the following characters in place of the regular forward-slash (U+002F):
- U+2044 = Fraction Slash: `⁄`
- U+2215 = Division Slash: `∕`
- U+29F8 = Big Solidus: `⧸`
- U+FF0F = Fullwidth Solidus: `╱`
- U+2571 = Box Drawings Light Diagonal Upper Right to Lower Left: `╱`

## Putting the Alternative Slashes in Filenames in Linux [1.2]

1. On Linux, we can enter a Unicode character by pressing the `<CTRL>+<SHIFT>+u` keys.
2. As we press the keys, we can notice a lower-case underlined “u” that indicates the prompt for entering a Unicode identifier.
