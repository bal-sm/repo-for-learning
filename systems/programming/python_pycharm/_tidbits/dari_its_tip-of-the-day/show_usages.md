# Show usages

You can view the list of all usages of a class, method or variable across the whole project, and quickly navigate to the selected item. Place the caret at a symbol and press `Ctrl+Alt+7` (Edit -> Find Usages -> Show Usages).

To jump to a usage, select it from the list and press `Enter`.

## Misalnya

```
`city` variable from `meteo` -> `views.py`
  |- `city = random_item.city`
  |- `'city': city` (maksudnya di `context`-nya gening)
```

## My note(s)
