# Start Here

Create a blank HTML file somewhere on your computer with a name like: `i-love-alpine.html`

Using a text editor, fill the file with these contents:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 x-data="{ message: 'I ❤️ Alpine' }" x-text="message"></h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Open your file in a web browser, if you see `I ❤️ Alpine`, you're ready to rumble!

    - you should be more than equipped
      - to start building stuff on your own. Let's goooooo.
