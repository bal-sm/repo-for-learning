## htmx in a Nutshell - Introduction - Mahmuda's version

- `htmx` is a library
  - that allows you
    - to access modern browser features
      - **directly** from HTML,
      - *rather* than using JavaScript.

- To understand `htmx`,
  - first lets take a look at an anchor tag:

```html
<a href="/blog">Blog</a>
```

This anchor tag tells a browser:

> - When a user clicks on this link,
>   - issue an HTTP GET request to `/blog`
>   - and load the response content
>     - **into** the browser window.

---

With that in mind, consider the following bit of HTML:

```html
<button hx-post="/clicked"
    hx-trigger="click"
    hx-target="#parent-div"
    hx-swap="outerHTML"
>
    Click Me!
</button>
```

This tells `htmx`:

> - When a user clicks on this button,
>   - issue an HTTP POST request
>     - to `/clicked`
>   - and use the content from the response
>     - to replace the element
>       - with the id `parent-div` in the DOM

---

- `htmx` extends
  - and generalizes
    - the core idea of HTML
      - as a hypertext,
  - opening up many more possibilities directly within the language:
    - Now any element,
      - not just anchors and forms,
        - can issue an HTTP request
    - Now any event,
      - not just clicks or form submissions,
        - can trigger requests
    - Now any [HTTP verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Verbs),
      - not just `GET` and `POST`,
        - can be used
    - Now any element,
      - not just the entire window,
        - can be the target for update by the request

---

- Note that
  - when you are using `htmx`,
    - on the server side
  - you typically respond:
    - **with** *`HTML`*,
    - **not** *`JSON`*.
  - This keeps you firmly
    - within the [original web programming model](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm),
    - using [Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
    - without even needing to really understand that concept.
