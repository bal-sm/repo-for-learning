# Django Views — The Right Way

Mine:
> udah we kodenya aja yang ditulis di sini, biar serasa "udah dibaca da ini teh".

## Intro

Them, dirangkum:
> I’ve also added extra bits (in this guide) for common tasks and patterns in FBVs for which CBVs are often suggested as the solution.

Them:
> I have a few aims:
> - I want to show how simple and easy views can be.
> - I want you to be freed from learning _a whole stack of additional APIs_ that were only making your life harder (and teaching you bad patterns).
>   - > this is very important.
> - Instead of learning a bunch of Django specific APIs, I want to cover much more transferable knowledge:
>   - HTTP principles
>   - General OOP/multi-paradigm programming principles
>   - General Python techniques
>
> And there are some other goodies along the way, like how to type-check all the URL parameters to your view functions.

Them, dirangkum:
> Each page is composed of two parts, which have two different audiences.
> - First, the business — the what and how: a short, definitive guide to The Right Way.
>   - > For beginners.
> - Second, discussion — the why: a longer, in-depth explanation of why everyone else who tells you differently is wrong :-)
>   - > Mengajari orang yang keras kepala, cenah.

Mine:
> Dari dulu kek aku ngerangkum ini.

## The Right Way

### The Pattern

`views.py`:

```python
from django.template.response import TemplateResponse

def example_view(request, arg):
    return TemplateResponse(request, 'example.html', {})
```

`urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('example/<str:arg>/', views.example_view, name='example_name'),
]
```

Yang penting diingat:
> - ...
> - `arg` is a placeholder for any number of optional URL parameters —
>   - parts of the URL path that you are matching with a [path converter](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/#path-converters)
>     - (here we used `str`)
>   - and supplying to the view function as a parameter.
>   - You can remove it, or add more, but have to change the URLconf to match.
> - In `urls.py`, you change the arguments to `path` to be, respectively:
>   - the matched URL (with any captured parts),
>   - your view function defined above,
>   - and an optional name that needs to be unique across your project, e.g. `home` or `myapp_articles_list`, to enable [URL reversing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/urls/#reverse-resolution-of-urls).
>     - > `rfl`-keun ih ieu.
>     - > terus saya mah pake nama view-nya lagi aja.

### The Explanation

Mine:
> rangkum gak yah?

Them:
> First, it’s vital to know what a view **is**. As the [Django docs state](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/views/):
> > A view…is a Python function that takes a Web request and returns a Web response

---

Mine:
> Maka, salah contoh "a view" adalah seperti ini:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello world!')
```

Mine:
> Jadi gini,
>
> User's browser -> "some Django's thing" -> [`HttpRequest`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest) -> `request` -> `urls.py` -> `hello_world` function -> [`HttpResponse`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse) -> "some Django's thing again" -> User's browser.

Them:
> .... It then returns an [`HttpResponse`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse) object as its return value. This contains all the data to be sent back to the user’s browser — HTTP headers and body, which is typically a web page. In our case, we sent just the text `Hello world!`.
>
> This request-response cycle is the heart of the Django web framework.

Mine, learning note:
> - [ ] Baca lebih lanjut [ieu](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/request-response/),
>   - [ ] dan rangkum.

---

Them:
> `urls.py` to hook the view up to a URL:

```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello_world, name='hello_world'),
]
```

---

Mine:
> ykiyk, cuman masukkin aja deh.

Them:
> In many cases, we want a single view function to actually match a family of URLs which have some kind of parameter in them, and access that parameter in our view function. Django has built-in support for this. Suppose we want to match URLs like `/hello/XXX/` where `XXX` could be any string. Then our URLconf becomes:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/<str:my_arg>/', views.hello_world, name='hello_world'),
]
```

Them:
> and our view signature:

```python
def hello_world(request, my_arg):
    # etc
```

---

_Skipped explanation_

Mine, udah we gini aja:
> pokoknya kita pastinya gak mau pake hanya sekedar teks biasa doang sebagai respon ke browser pengguna, nah makanya memberi suatu HTML yang sangat terstruktur, which is bagusnya pake Django's template engine, which is ykiyk.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader


def hello_world(request, my_arg):
    template = loader.get_template('hello_world.html')
    context = {}
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
```

---

_Skipped the explanation_

Mine:
> cuman _part of that code_ terus ditulis berulang-ulang, makanya ada shortcut-nya, yaitu pake `render()`, kayak gini:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render


def hello_world(request, my_arg):
    return render(request, 'hello_world.html', {})
```

---

Them, penting gak penting ini:
> This is a great pattern for writing views. Django has one more trick up its sleeve, however — [`TemplateResponse`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/template-response/#templateresponse-objects).
>
> The issue with just using `render` is that you get a plain `HttpResponse` object back that has no memory that it ever came from a template. Sometimes, however, it is useful to have functions return a value that does remember what it’s “made of” — something that stores the template it is from, and the context. This can be really useful in testing, but also if we want to something outside of our view function (such as decorators or middleware) to check or even change what’s in the response before it finally gets ‘rendered’ and sent to the user.
>
> For now, you can just accept that `TemplateResponse` is a more useful return value than a plain `HttpResponse`. (If you are already using `render` everywhere, there is absolutely no need to go and change it though, and almost everything in this guide will work exactly the same with `render` instead of `TemplateResponse`).
>
> With that substitution, we’ve arrived at the pattern you’ll want to start with for views:

Mine:
> udah we pokoknya kalo aku mau pake good ol' `render()` aja, terus kalo misalnya aneh-aneh gitu, pake testing sama 'middleware' shit-nya segala, ubah aja langsung ke `TemplateResponse`. sudah terbiasa `render()` ey.

```python
from django.template.response import TemplateResponse

def example_view(request, arg):
    return TemplateResponse(request, 'example.html', {})
```

---

Them:
> You need to know what each bit is, as described above. **But that is the end of the lesson**. You can skip to the next part. Or you can even just stop reading — you now know all the essentials of writing HTML views in Django.

Mine:
> Memang sih.. cuman aku pengen lebih tau.

Them:
> You don’t need to learn any of the CBV APIs - `TemplateView`, `ListView`, `DetailView`, `FormView`, `MultipleObjectMixin` etc. etc. and all their inheritance trees or method flowcharts. They will only make your life harder. Print out their documentation, put in a shed — or rather, a warehouse [given how much there is](https://ccbv.co.uk/) — fill the warehouse with dynamite and [don’t look back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo).

Mine:
> I believe you:
> - Pokoknya memang gitu, udah we ya buat sekarang mending comot-comot aja dari rangkuman of complex things to a `context` terus tampilannya gimana ke user, terus kalo ngelakuin suatu interaction, berarti mengacu ke suatu end point, yang akhirnya nyuruh Django to do something complicated, on whatever it is (ORMs, cleaning forms, etc..). That's basically what a view is.
>   - > Soalnya gening yah, aku teh kepikiran biar, the new canon-uncanon programming teh a thing, how those codes are corrent in every way possible, but how do you want people to see it,
>     - > Who am I? I'm not even one of developers lollz.
>   - > terus sebenernya CBV tersebut doesn't actually include how to organize your CSS, and JS, etc. CMIIW. use `django-components` guys.

### Discussion: keep the view viewable! - TL;DR version of mine

Mine:
> Pokoknya karena pake FBV, jadinya kita punya suatu pola:
> - a function ✓
> - that takes an argument called request ✓
> - and returns some kind of response — a TemplateResponse ✓
>
> Dan akhirnya membuat suatu `view` itu sangatlah mudah dan simpel.

Mine:
> Coba kalo gini:

```python
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

class ExampleView(TemplateView):
    template_name = "example.html"
```

Mine:
> Jadinya the simplicity of the patterns of making a view-nya tuh ilang:
> - ~~a function~~, it's a class, obfuscated code.
> - ~~that takes an argument called request~~, ilang.
> - ~~and returns some kind of response — a TemplateResponse~~, gak ada.

Them:
> You might think “this is shorter than the FBV” is one of the advantages. It is, slightly, but as soon as you add the need for [context data](https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/context-data.html) this advantage disappears, and we’ll find we have [more boilerplate](https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/context-data.html#boilerplate), not less, with CBVs.

> Biarin we ya materi aslinya diginiin aja wkwkw, namanya juga buat sendiri.
