# Django Views — The Right Way

Mine:
> udah we kodenya aja yang ditulis di sini, biar serasa "udah dibaca da ini teh".

## Intro

Them, dirangkum:
> I’ve also added extra bits (in this guide) for common tasks and patterns in FBVs for which CBVs are often suggested as the solution.

Them:
> I have a few aims:
> - I want to show how simple and easy views can be.
> - I want you to be freed from learning _a whole stack of additional APIs_ that were only making your life harder (and teaching you bad patterns).
>   - > this is very important.
> - Instead of learning a bunch of Django specific APIs, I want to cover much more transferable knowledge:
>   - HTTP principles
>   - General OOP/multi-paradigm programming principles
>   - General Python techniques
>
> And there are some other goodies along the way, like how to type-check all the URL parameters to your view functions.
