# Search - WIP

- A common task for web applications is to *search* *some* **data**
  - _(in the database with user input)_.
  - In a simple case, this could be
    - filtering a list of objects by a category. 
  - A more complex use case might require searching with
    - weighting, 
    - categorization, 
    - highlighting, 
    - multiple languages, 
    - and so on. 
  - This document explains some of the possible use cases and the tools you can use.

Weâ€™ll refer to the same models used in [Making queries](./2_queries.md#models-used-as-reference).
