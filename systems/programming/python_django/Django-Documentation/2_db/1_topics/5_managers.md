`class Manager` / `django.db.models.Manager`

- A `Manager` is the *interface* through which database query operations are provided to Django *models*. 
  - At least one `Manager` exists for every model in a Django application.

The way `Manager` classes work is documented in [Making queries](./2_queries.md); this document specifically touches on model options that customize `Manager` behavior.
