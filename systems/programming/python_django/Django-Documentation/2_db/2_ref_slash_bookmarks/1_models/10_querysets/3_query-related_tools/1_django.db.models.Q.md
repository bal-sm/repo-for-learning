# `Q()` objects — `django.db.models.Q` class

A `Q()` object represents an SQL condition that can be used in database-related operations. It’s similar to how an `F()` object represents the value of a model field or annotation. They make it possible to define and reuse conditions, and combine them using operators such as `|` (`OR`), `&` (`AND`), and `^` (`XOR`). See [Complex lookups with `Q` objects](../../../../1_topics/2_queries.md#complex-lookups-with-q-objects--mahmudas-version).
