## Answer

GitHub Copilot:
> Sure, here's a brief explanation of Python's `return` keyword:

The `return` keyword in Python is used to exit a function and return a value. When the `return` statement is executed, the function terminates immediately. If the `return` statement is without any expression, then the special value `None` is returned. If there is no `return` statement in the function code, the function will end, when the control flow reaches the end of the function body and `None` will be returned.

Here are some other Python keywords and their brief explanations:

- `def`: This keyword is used to declare functions in Python.
- `if`, `elif`, `else`: These keywords are used for conditional branching or decision making.
- `for`, `while`: These keywords are used for looping. `for` is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list or a string) or other iterable objects. `while` is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true.
- `break`: This keyword is used to break out of the smallest enclosing loop.
- `continue`: This keyword is used to skip the rest of the code inside the enclosing loop for the current iteration only.
- `class`: This keyword is used to declare user-defined classes.
- `try`, `except`, `finally`: These keywords are used for exception handling. `try` block is used for the code that can raise an exception, `except` block is used to catch and handle the exception and `finally` block is used to declare the code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception has occurred or not.
