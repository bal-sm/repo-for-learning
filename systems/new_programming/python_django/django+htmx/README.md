## [htmx in a Nutshell](https://htmx.org/docs/#introduction)

- `htmx` is a library that 
  - allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML, rather than using JavaScript.

```html
<a href="/blog">Blog</a>
```

This anchor tag tells a browser:
> - When a user clicks on this link:
>   - issue an `HTTP` `GET` request to `/blog` and 
>   - load the response content into the browser window.

With that in mind, consider the following bit of HTML:

```html
<button hx-post="/clicked"
    hx-trigger="click"
    hx-target="#parent-div"
    hx-swap="outerHTML"
>
    Click Me!
</button>
```

This tells htmx:
> - When a user clicks on this button:
>   - issue an `HTTP` `POST` request to `/clicked` and 
>   - use _the **content** from the response_ to 
>     - **replace** _the element with the id `parent-div`_ in the [`DOM`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp).

---

- `htmx` extends and generalizes the core idea of `HTML` as a _**hypertext**_, 
  > opening up many more possibilities directly within the language:
  - **Now** any element, not just anchors and forms, can issue an HTTP request
    > Misalnya kayak button di atas tadi, terus HTTP request a response text yang bakal ditaro di id yang namanya `parent-div`
  - **Now** any event, not just clicks or form submissions, can trigger requests
    > Okay, learning-in-progress , fill this plz maksudnya gimana.
  - **Now** any _[HTTP verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Verbs)_, not just `GET` and `POST`, can be used
    > learning-in-progress , is it really necessary to use these HTTP verbs?
  - Now any element, not just the entire window, can be the target for update by the request
    > kayak tadi `parent-div` tea

Note that: (very important) 
> when you are using `htmx`, on the server side you _typically respond with `HTML`_, **not `JSON`**. 
> 
> This keeps you firmly within the [original web programming model](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm), 

Mine:
> Ew, wtf reads that.

The rest of the note:
> using [Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) without even needing to really understand that concept.

Mine:
> Okay, y'know, kayak biasa aja bacot aneh-aneh gening, padahal simple conceptnya, kayak wtf is out of band coba.

Itâ€™s worth mentioning that, if you prefer, you can use the `data-` prefix when using htmx:

```html
<a data-hx-post="/click">Click Me!</a>
```

Mine:
> Buat apa coba, kita liat aja vid nya bugbytes.

## Notebook of Video 1 by Bugbytes

```html
...
{{ form.username.errors }}
{% render_field form.username class="form-control" _hx-things_ %}
...
```

_hx-things_:

```html
hx-posts="/check_username/" hx-trigger="keyup" hx-target="#username-error"
```

> Jadinya, user name di cek setiap saat apakah udah ada, takutnya nanti duplicate, terus di cek stiap tekan tombol keyboard.

Updated html:

```html
{{ form.username.errors }}
{% render_field form.username class="form-control" hx-post="/check_username/" hx-trigger="keyup" hx-target="#username-error" %}
<div id="username-error"></div> <!-- ini nanti diganti sama hx-target -->
```

```python
class RegisterForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ["username", "password1", "password2"]
```

```python
def check_username(request):
    username = request.POST.get(
        "username"
    )  # get from the `hx-post`, and `RegisterForm` filled form `username` tea
    if get_user_model().objects.filter(username=username).exists():
        return HttpResponse("This username is already exists")
    else:
        return HttpResponse("This username is available, guys.")
```

### [Swapping](https://htmx.org/docs/#swapping) example

What if:

```html
{{ form.username.errors }}
{% render_field form.username class="form-control" hx-post="/check_username/" hx-swap="outerHTML" hx-trigger="keyup" hx-target="#username-error" %}
<div id="username-error"></div> <!-- ini nanti diganti sama hx-target -->
```

emphasize on **`hx-swap="outerHTML"`**

then,

```python
def check_username(request):
    username = request.POST.get(
        "username"
    )  # get from the `hx-post`, and `RegisterForm` filled form `username` tea
    if get_user_model().objects.filter(username=username).exists():
        return HttpResponse("<div style='color: red;'>This username is already exists</div>")
    else:
        return HttpResponse("<div style='color: green;'>This username is available, guys.</div>")
```

So, the output will be ðŸŒˆcoloredðŸŒˆ.

Note 3 from [reddit, HTMX and Alpine.js](https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/s00xij/htmx_and_alpinejs/) (VERY IMPORTANT, LIKE VERY VERY IMPORTANT):

> Question:
>
> Hey everyone,
> 
> I recently started experimenting with HTMX on my Django project and I absolutely love it. Other people in this sub have been saying that htmx pairs really well with alpine.js so I started looking up tutorials on it.
> 
> My question is how do you pair these 2 together? What is a common practice?
>
> Answer:
>
> - Iâ€™m simplifying but:
>   - _**alpine** replaces js that doesnâ€™t interact with the server_ and 
>   - **htmx** covers js that **does**.
> 
> **A drop down menu toggle**[999, wow] would be something you would use alpine for and not htmx. If you use a component framework like bootstrap youâ€™ll probably be fine without alpine for most cases.
> 
> As a far as pairing goes, just include the scripts in your template and go wild.

Mine:
> Wow guys baca [999, wow], a drop down menu/menu bar, undo, redo, edit, etc, guys. This is very important.

Note 4, still by Author of Note 3 (Very-very Important):

Question:
> Okay got it. I'm already using bootstrap so I was a little confused about the utility of alpine.js. Bootstrap already offers a lot of dynamic content with tabs, dropdowns, etc
>
> Same with Django, I was looking at the x-for attribute in alpine.js for example and it's something that could be achievable directly with HTMX and Django template tags.
>
> ~~However, there is one functionality that I was hoping I could maybe get from HTMX or alpine.js, and that would be to be able to update the content of a chart.js script without getting too involved with JavaScript. But since HTMX returns html, I don't think that I will have any other options~~ (not important part of the question)

Answer by [u/_htmx](https://www.reddit.com/user/_htmx/) themself:
> Alpine will overlap to an extent with what bootstrap gives you as far as front end functionality goes, but it is much more general and powerful.
>
> Also, using Alpine, you can hook into the htmx event model, [which is extensive](https://htmx.org/reference/#events), in a nice, inline manner that is consistent with the [Locality of Behavior](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/) of htmx. This would be an advanced use case, but might come up as you get deeper into things.
>
> Alpine is a great investment of time IMO. It has a very high power to weight ratio when compared w/ other SPA libraries.
>
> I also have to mention, on general principle, [hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/), a front end scripting language that we are working on alongside htmx. It is for crazy people only, but it has some interesting functionality and fills a similar niche to Alpine: light, event-driven front end scripting. Don't use it. :)
