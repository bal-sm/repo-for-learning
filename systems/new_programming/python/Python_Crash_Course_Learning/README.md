# Python Crash Course - Learning

by Eric Matthes on no starch press.

## Praise For Python Crash Course

Great Lakes Geek:
> While Python Crash Course uses Python to teach you to code, it also teaches clean programming skills that apply to most other languages.

## Learning in Progress

### From PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

My question:
> What is herein?

Note 1:
> use `pathlib` cenah, buat read and write file, karna lebih simple.

Note 2:
> Chapter 11 uses `pytest` to write automated tests for the code you write. The `pytest` library has become the industry standard tool for writing tests in Python.
> 
> It’s friendly enough to use for your first tests, and if you pursue a career as a Python programmer, you’ll use it in professional settings as well.

Note 3:
> The index has been thoroughly updated to allow you to use Python Crash Course as a reference for all of your future Python projects.

Mine:
> Wow.
