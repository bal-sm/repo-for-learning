# What I Use for programming with Python

## IDE

- Visual Studio Code
  
  I don't really see the need of PyCharm IDE. 'cause, I like VSCode, it's clean. But apparently some people says that:

- PyCharm
  
  is the best for:
  - its refactoring tools
  - its search engine (omG, I can see it though, VSCode sucks at searching class, function, etc or I just don't know yet)
  - ~~its not autocomplete the `self` argument in class methods~~ (I don't think it's a problem for me)
  - ~~git integration~~ (I love VSCode git integration more, especially with GitLens ext, omG, are u kidding?)
  - Remote remote gitu gening cenah susah tapi. Aku juga bingung tentang itu. Tapi at least aku berhasil di VSCode

  And also kalo code with Django:
  - reformatter for templates
  - debugger, I think

## Packages

- `Poetry`
- `pyupgrade`
- and for django, `django-upgrade`, etc, etc, maybe I should dedicate Django's what I use readme instead in here.
- `black`kkkk omG, sumpah demi Allah, jadi rapih bgt code aku
