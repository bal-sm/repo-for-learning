# What I Use for programming with Python

## IDE

- Visual Studio Code
  
  I don't really see the need of PyCharm IDE. 'cause, I like VSCode, it's clean. But apparently some people says that:

- PyCharm Professional
  
  is the best for:
  - its refactoring tools
  - its search engine (omG, I can see it though, VSCode sucks at searching class, function, etc or I just don't know yet)
  - ~~its not autocomplete the `self` argument in class methods~~ (I don't think it's a problem for me)
  - ~~git integration~~ (I love VSCode git integration more, especially with GitLens ext, omG, are u kidding?)
  - Remote remote gitu gening cenah susah tapi. Aku juga bingung tentang itu. Tapi at least aku berhasil di VSCode

  And also kalo code with Django:
  - reformatter for templates
  - debugger, I think

Back to
- VSCode
  
  So, I really, again, don't see the need of PyCharm Professional. With its official Python extension omG, it's so good. But I maybe still use PyCharm Professional as a secondary IDE.

### Makanya, kalo lagi pake `VSCode`

- `Search Everywhere` feature
  - Kan kalo di JetBrains PyCharm, ada `Search Everywhere`, by pushing `Shift` key, twice.
  - Nah kalo di VSCode, ada `Go to Symbol in Workspace` command dari `Command Palette`, which is bound by default to `Ctrl + T` shortcut.
    - > Nanti coba ubah aja dari `Ctrl + T` jadi apa gitu loh

> Nanti liat aja di [Python_Crash_Course_Learning](./Python_Crash_Course_Learning/README.md) for more, shortcut, terus plz me, pindahin juga ke sini.

## Packages

- `Poetry`
- `pyupgrade`
- and for django, `django-upgrade`, etc, etc, maybe I should dedicate Django's what I use readme instead in here.
- `black`kkkk omG, sumpah demi Allah, jadi rapih bgt code aku
