I don't subscribe to streaming services. (Don't worry, I can afford streaming services. It just that so many mainstream streaming services that don't moderate their content and often kinda offensive towards specific audience) 
I won't watch Dune 2 either, because it makes my feelings hurt. Timothee Chalamet is not the Mahdi lol wth
