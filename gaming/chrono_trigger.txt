Hate to say it, Chrono Trigger has the most interesting story line in the history of gaming world. But it also has a *strong* islamphobia undertone, just like Resident Evil 4, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, etc. 

And I love you (Muhammad saw.), so I have to say that I hate those kinds of games.
