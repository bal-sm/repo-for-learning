## Part One: Financial Statements

### CHAPTER ONE: The Accounting Equation

`Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity`

Keterangan:
- Assets: All of the property owned by the company.
- Liabilities: All of the debts that the company currently has outstanding to lenders.
- Owners’ Equity (a.k.a. Shareholders’ Equity): **The company’s ownership interest in its assets, after all debts have been repaid.** (1)

Mine(1):
> Kayak omG my car, I want to give it as an asset for my company.

#### My Asset is Your Liability

- ... a liability for one person is, in fact, an asset for somebody else.
  - For example, if you take out a loan with your bank:
    - the loan is clearly a **liability** _for you_.
    - From _the perspective of your bank_, however, the loan is an **asset**.

Ignore this:
> - Similarly, the balance in your savings or checking account is,
>   - of course, an asset (to you).
>   - For the bank, however, the balance is a liability.
>     - It’s money that they owe you, as you’re allowed to demand full or partial payment of it at any time.

Mine:
> Whatever is savings or checking account means.

### CHAPTER TWO: The Balance Sheet

The book:
> A company’s balance sheet shows its financial situation at a given point in time. It is, quite simply, a formal presentation of the accounting equation.

#### Assets

- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Balances in checking and savings accounts, as well as any investments that will mature within 3 months or less.
- **Inventory**: Goods kept in stock, available for sale.
- **Accounts Receivable**: Amounts due from customers for goods or services that have already been delivered.
- **Property, Plant, and Equipment**: Assets that cannot readily be converted into cash—things such as computers, manufacturing equipment, vehicles, furniture, etc.

#### Liabilities

- **Accounts Payable**: Amounts due to suppliers for goods or services that have already been received.
- **Notes Payable**: Contractual obligations due to lenders (e.g., bank loans).

#### Owners’ Equity

- **Common Stock**: Amounts invested by the owners of the company.
- **Retained Earnings**: The sum of all net income over the life of the business that has not been distributed to owners in the form of a dividend.

#### Current vs. Long-Term

- **Current assets** are those that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months or less.
  - Accounts Receivable, Cash, and Inventory.
- Everything that isn’t a current asset is, by default, **a long-term asset** (a.k.a. non-current asset).
  - Property, Plant, and Equipment.
- **Current liabilities** are those that will need to be paid off within 12 months or less.
  - Accounts Payable.
- **Long-term Liabilities**
  - (_Notes Payable that are paid off over a period of time are split up on the balance sheet so that the next 12 months’ payments are shown as a current liability, while the remainder of the note is shown as a long-term liability._)

#### Multiple-Period Balance Sheets

### CHAPTER THREE: The Income Statement

- A company’s **income statement** shows the company’s financial performance over a period of time (usually one year).
  - This is in contrast to the **balance sheet**, which shows financial position at a point in time.

**Income Statement**
|                    | ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ |                  |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------: |
| **Revenue**        |             |                  |
| Sales              |             |         $300,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold |             | <u>(100,000)</u> |
| Gross Profit       |             |   <u>200,000</u> |
|                    | ⠀           |                  |
| **Expenses**       |             |                  |
| Rent               |             |           30,000 |
| Salaries and Wages |             |           80,000 |
| Advertising        |             |           15,000 |
| Insurance          |             |    <u>10,000</u> |
| Total Expenses     |             |   <u>135,000</u> |
|                    | ⠀           |                  |
| **Net Income**     |             |          $65,000 |

Mine:
> Wow for `⠀` character.

#### Gross Profit and Cost of Goods Sold

- `Gross profit = "the sum of a company’s revenues" - Cost of Goods Sold`
- **Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS)** is the amount that the company **paid** for the goods that it **sold** _over the course of the period_.

Example:
- Laura
  - Bought 100 t-shirts for $12 each.
  - Sold all of those t-shirts for $2,500. _Sales = $2,500_
  - CoGS = $1,200
  - Gross Profit = $1,300
- Rich
  - His costs are all overhead.
    - 'cause he is selling services.
    - which is preparing tax returns.
  - each additional return he prepares adds nothing to his total costs
    - so he has no Cost of Goods Sold
  - His gross profit is simply equal to his revenues.

#### Operating Income vs. Net Income

- Sometimes, you need to separates operating revenues and expenses from non-operating revenues and expenses on income statements.
  - Operating revenues are those coming from the sale of the business’s primary products or services.
  - Operating expenses are the expenses related to the core operation of the business.
- Non-operating revenues and expenses are those that are unrelated to the core operations of the business.
- The point of separating operating revenues and expenses from non-operating revenues and expenses is
  - to allow for the calculation of operating income.

### CHAPTER FOUR: The Statement of Retained Earnings

- Very **brief** financial statement
- Only has 1 purpose:
  - to detail the **changes** in a _company’s retained earnings_ over a period of time.
- Again, retained earnings is the sum of all of a company’s _undistributed_ profits over the entire existence of the company.
  - **“undistributed” profits** vs profits that have been **distributed** to company shareholders in the form of _dividend_ payments.

#### Example of _The Statement of Retained Earnings_

- ABC Construction
  - formed on 1st January 2013.
  - it naturally has a **Retained Earnings balance of zero** ⬅️ _(At its date of formation,)_
    - _(because it hasn’t had any net income yet)_.

- Over the course of 2013, ABC Construction
  - **Net income is $50,000**.
  - In December of the year, it **pays a dividend of $20,000** to its shareholders.

Retained earnings statement for the year:

| **Statement of Retained Earnings** |                 |
| :--------------------------------- | --------------: |
| Retained Earnings, 1/1/2013        |              $0 |
| Net Income                         |          50,000 |
| Dividends Paid to Shareholders     | <u>(20,000)</u> |
| Retained Earnings, 12/31/2013      |  <u>$30,000</u> |

- If, in 2014, ABC Construction:
  - **Net income was $70,000** and,
  - it again **paid a $20,000 dividend**

Its 2014 retained earnings statement would appear as follows:

| **Statement of Retained Earnings** |                 |
| :--------------------------------- | --------------: |
| Retained Earnings, 1/1/2014        | $30,000         |
| Net Income                         | 70,000          |
| Dividends Paid to Shareholders     | <u>(20,000)</u> |
| Retained Earnings, 12/31/2014      | <u>$80,000</u>  |

#### Bridge Between Financial Statements

- The statement of retained earnings functions much like _a bridge between the income statement and the balance sheet_.
  - `Income Statement` ➡️ **`Statement of Retained Earnings`** ➡️ `Balance Sheet`
    - It _takes information_ from **the income statement**, and
    - it _provides information_ to **the balance sheet**.

Let's break that relationship down:

##### Step "1": The Processed Income Statement

The final step of preparing an income statement is _calculating **the company’s net income**_:

**Income Statement**
| 1                  |               2 |
| :----------------- | --------------: |
| **Revenue**        |                 |
| Sales              | <u>$240,000</u> |
| Gross Profit       |  <u>240,000</u> |
|                    |                 |
| **Expenses**       |                 |
| Rent               |          70,000 |
| Salaries and Wages |   <u>80,000</u> |
| Total Expenses     |  <u>150,000</u> |
|                    |         _______ |
| **Net Income**     |  <u>$90,000</u> |

##### Step "2": The Making of Statement of Retained Earnings

- **Net income** is then _used in **the statement of retained earnings**_
  - _to calculate the end-of-year **balance** in **Retained Earnings**_:

My note:
> I wish `flow` thing tea udah ada ih, jadi `$90,000` nya ke sini, gitu loh.

**Statement of Retained Earnings**
| 1                              |               2 |
| :----------------------------- | --------------: |
| Retained Earnings, Beginning   |         $40,000 |
| Net Income                     |          90,000 |
| Dividends Paid to Shareholders | <u>(50,000)</u> |
| Retained Earnings, Ending      |  <u>$80,000</u> |

##### Step "3": The Aftermath, Balance Sheet

- _The ending Retained Earnings balance_
  - is then used to _prepare the company’s **end-of-year balance sheet**_:

| 1                                   |               2 |
| :---------------------------------- | --------------: |
| Assets                              |                 |
| Cash and Cash Equivalents           |        $130,000 |
| Inventory                           |   <u>80,000</u> |
| Total Assets:                       |  <u>210,000</u> |
|                                     |                 |
| Liabilities                         |                 |
| Accounts Payable                    |   <u>20,000</u> |
| Total Liabilities:                  |   <u>20,000</u> |
|                                     |                 |
| Owners’ Equity                      |                 |
| Common Stock                        |         110,000 |
| Retained Earnings                   |   <u>80,000</u> |
| Total Owners’ Equity                |  <u>190,000</u> |
|                                     |     _______     |
| Total Liabilities + Owners’ Equity: | <u>$210,000</u> |

##### Notes

```{note}
`Divident Payments` =/= `Expense`

Emang sih dua-duanya pembayaran kas (cash payments) kepada pihak lain, cuman bedanya kalo `Divident Payments` itu distribusi dari keuntungan perusahaan kepada pemegang saham. Sehingga kalkulasinya tercantum pada `Statement of Retained Earnings`, bukan `Income Statement`
```

```{note}
`Retained Earnings` =/= `Cash`

Memang kan definisi dari `Retained Earnings` (Pendapatan yang Tersimpan/Ditahan) adalah laba yang belum terdistribusi atas seluruh keberadaan perusahaan, dapat membuat kita berpikir: ~~bahwa _ini_ adalah sama dengan kas.~~

Hanya karena sebuah perusahaan belum membagikan keuntungannya kepada pemiliknya, bukan berarti perusahaan tersebut belum menggunakannya untuk hal lain.

Misalnya, keuntungan sering kali diinvestasikan kembali untuk mengembangkan perusahaan dengan membeli lebih banyak persediaan untuk dijual atau membeli lebih banyak peralatan untuk produksi.
```

Mine:
> Note `Retained Earnings` =/= `Cash` butuh diringkas lagi.

Note (?):
> Simple summary harus dimasukkin gak ya? Enggak dulu deh.

### CHAPTER FIVE: The Cash Flow Statement

- The Cash Flow Statement
  - It reports _a company’s cash **inflows** and **outflows** over an accounting period._

#### Cash Flow Statement vs. Income Statement

- Cash Flow Statement =/= Income Statement
  - Why?

##### The 1st major difference

In English:
> First, there are often differences in timing between when an income or expense item is recorded and when the cash actually comes in or goes out the door.

Dalam Indonesia:
> Sering kali terdapat perbedaan waktu antara waktu **pencatatan pendapatan atau pengeluaran** dan waktu dimana uang tunai **benar-benar diterima atau dikeluarkan**.

My note(?):
> Bagus gak sih format gini?

**EXAMPLE:**

- In September, XYZ Consulting
  - _performs marketing services for a customer_
    - who **does not pay until** the beginning of October.
  - In September, this sale would be **recorded as an increase** in _both Sales and Accounts Receivable._
    - _(And the sale would show up on a September **income statement**.)_

  TODO:
  > INSERT THE JOURNAL HERE, PLEASE.

  - _The cash,_ however, isn’t actually **received until October**,
    - so the activity **would not appear** on _September’s cash flow statement_.

Mine:
> See? A record of income/expense **can/cannot** with its cash flow yet. Gitu we lah (sic, lebih teu puguh we sih bahasana).

##### The 2nd major difference

- between them is that:
  - The cash flow statement includes:
    - several types of transactions that **are not included** in _the income statement._

**EXAMPLE 1:**

- XYZ Consulting **takes out a loan** with its bank.
  - The loan will not appear on the income statement,
    - as the transaction is neither a revenue item nor an expense item.
  - It is simply an **increase** of _an asset (Cash) and a liability (Notes Payable)_.
  - **However**, because it’s a cash inflow,
    - the loan **will appear on the cash flow statement**.

**EXAMPLE 2:**

- XYZ Consulting **pays** _its shareholders a $30,000 dividend_.
  - _(As discussed in Chapter 4)_, dividends **are not** an expense.
    - **Therefore**, the dividend **will not appear** on the _income statement_.
    - It will, **however**, **appear** on the _cash flow statement as a cash outflow_.

#### Categories of Cash Flow

On a cash flow statement, all _cash inflows_ or _outflows_ are _separated into one of three categories_:

- [Cash flow from operating activities](#cash-flow-from-operating-activities),
- [Cash flow from investing activities](#cash-flow-from-investing-activities), and
- [Cash flow from financing activities](#cash-flow-from-financing-activities).

##### Cash Flow from Operating Activities

- Technically, cash flow from operating activities includes:
  - any cash flows **not specifically defined** as _investing or financing activities_.
- **The general idea, however,**
