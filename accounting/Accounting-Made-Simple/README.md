## Part One: Financial Statements

### Chapter One: The Accounting Equation

`Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity`

Keterangan:
- Assets: All of the property owned by the company.
- Liabilities: All of the debts that the company currently has outstanding to lenders.
- Owners’ Equity (a.k.a. Shareholders’ Equity): **The company’s ownership interest in its assets, after all debts have been repaid.** (1)

Mine(1):
> Kayak omG my car, I want to give it as an asset for my company.

#### My Asset is Your Liability

- ... a liability for one person is, in fact, an asset for somebody else.
  - For example, if you take out a loan with your bank:
    - the loan is clearly a **liability** _for you_.
    - From _the perspective of your bank_, however, the loan is an **asset**.
