## Part One: Financial Statements

### CHAPTER ONE: The Accounting Equation

`Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity`

Keterangan:
- Assets: All of the property owned by the company.
- Liabilities: All of the debts that the company currently has outstanding to lenders.
- Owners’ Equity (a.k.a. Shareholders’ Equity): **The company’s ownership interest in its assets, after all debts have been repaid.** (1)

Mine(1):
> Kayak omG my car, I want to give it as an asset for my company.

#### My Asset is Your Liability

- ... a liability for one person is, in fact, an asset for somebody else.
  - For example, if you take out a loan with your bank:
    - the loan is clearly a **liability** _for you_.
    - From _the perspective of your bank_, however, the loan is an **asset**.

Ignore this:
> - Similarly, the balance in your savings or checking account is,
>   - of course, an asset (to you). 
>   - For the bank, however, the balance is a liability. 
>     - It’s money that they owe you, as you’re allowed to demand full or partial payment of it at any time.

Mine:
> Whatever is savings or checking account means.

### CHAPTER TWO: The Balance Sheet

The book:
> A company’s balance sheet shows its financial situation at a given point in time. It is, quite simply, a formal presentation of the accounting equation.

Mine:
> `Insert the table from the book to here, plz.

#### Assets

- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Balances in checking and savings accounts, as well as any investments that will mature within 3 months or less.
- **Inventory**: Goods kept in stock, available for sale.
- **Accounts Receivable**: Amounts due from customers for goods or services that have already been delivered.
- **Property, Plant, and Equipment**: Assets that cannot readily be converted into cash—things such as computers, manufacturing equipment, vehicles, furniture, etc.

#### Liabilities

- **Accounts Payable**: Amounts due to suppliers for goods or services that have already been received.
- **Notes Payable**: Contractual obligations due to lenders (e.g., bank loans).

#### Owners’ Equity

- **Common Stock**: Amounts invested by the owners of the company.
- **Retained Earnings**: The sum of all net income over the life of the business that has not been distributed to owners in the form of a dividend.

#### Current vs. Long-Term

- **Current assets** are those that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months or less.
  - Accounts Receivable, Cash, and Inventory.
- Everything that isn’t a current asset is, by default, **a long-term asset** (a.k.a. non-current asset).
  - Property, Plant, and Equipment.
- **Current liabilities** are those that will need to be paid off within 12 months or less.
  - Accounts Payable.
- **Long-term Liabilities**
  - (_Notes Payable that are paid off over a period of time are split up on the balance sheet so that the next 12 months’ payments are shown as a current liability, while the remainder of the note is shown as a long-term liability._)

Query?:
> is retained earnings account equity?

Just to make sure and have fun with ChatGPT guys lol:
> Yes, retained earnings account is a type of equity and is reported in the shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet. Retained earnings are the accumulated portion of a business’s profits that are not distributed as dividends to shareholders but instead are reserved for reinvestment back into the business. Retained earnings can be used to purchase assets or other investments.
