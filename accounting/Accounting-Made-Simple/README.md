## Part One: Financial Statements

### CHAPTER ONE: The Accounting Equation

`Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity`

Keterangan:
- Assets: All of the property owned by the company.
- Liabilities: All of the debts that the company currently has outstanding to lenders.
- Owners’ Equity (a.k.a. Shareholders’ Equity): **The company’s ownership interest in its assets, after all debts have been repaid.** (1)

Mine(1):
> Kayak omG my car, I want to give it as an asset for my company.

#### My Asset is Your Liability

- ... a liability for one person is, in fact, an asset for somebody else.
  - For example, if you take out a loan with your bank:
    - the loan is clearly a **liability** _for you_.
    - From _the perspective of your bank_, however, the loan is an **asset**.

Ignore this:
> - Similarly, the balance in your savings or checking account is,
>   - of course, an asset (to you). 
>   - For the bank, however, the balance is a liability. 
>     - It’s money that they owe you, as you’re allowed to demand full or partial payment of it at any time.

Mine:
> Whatever is savings or checking account means.

### CHAPTER TWO: The Balance Sheet

The book:
> A company’s balance sheet shows its financial situation at a given point in time. It is, quite simply, a formal presentation of the accounting equation.

#### Assets

- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Balances in checking and savings accounts, as well as any investments that will mature within 3 months or less.
- **Inventory**: Goods kept in stock, available for sale.
- **Accounts Receivable**: Amounts due from customers for goods or services that have already been delivered.
- **Property, Plant, and Equipment**: Assets that cannot readily be converted into cash—things such as computers, manufacturing equipment, vehicles, furniture, etc.

#### Liabilities

- **Accounts Payable**: Amounts due to suppliers for goods or services that have already been received.
- **Notes Payable**: Contractual obligations due to lenders (e.g., bank loans).

#### Owners’ Equity

- **Common Stock**: Amounts invested by the owners of the company.
- **Retained Earnings**: The sum of all net income over the life of the business that has not been distributed to owners in the form of a dividend.

#### Current vs. Long-Term

- **Current assets** are those that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months or less.
  - Accounts Receivable, Cash, and Inventory.
- Everything that isn’t a current asset is, by default, **a long-term asset** (a.k.a. non-current asset).
  - Property, Plant, and Equipment.
- **Current liabilities** are those that will need to be paid off within 12 months or less.
  - Accounts Payable.
- **Long-term Liabilities**
  - (_Notes Payable that are paid off over a period of time are split up on the balance sheet so that the next 12 months’ payments are shown as a current liability, while the remainder of the note is shown as a long-term liability._)

#### Multiple-Period Balance Sheets

### CHAPTER THREE: The Income Statement

- A company’s **income statement** shows the company’s financial performance over a period of time (usually one year).
  - This is in contrast to the **balance sheet**, which shows financial position at a point in time.

**Income Statement**
|                    | ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ |                  |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------: |
| **Revenue**        |             |                  |
| Sales              |             |         $300,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold |             | <u>(100,000)</u> |
| Gross Profit       |             |   <u>200,000</u> |
|                    | ⠀           |                  |
| **Expenses**       |             |                  |
| Rent               |             |           30,000 |
| Salaries and Wages |             |           80,000 |
| Advertising        |             |           15,000 |
| Insurance          |             |    <u>10,000</u> |
| Total Expenses     |             |   <u>135,000</u> |
|                    | ⠀           |                  |
| **Net Income**     |             |          $65,000 |

Mine:
> Wow for `⠀` character.

#### Gross Profit and Cost of Goods Sold

- `Gross profit = "the sum of a company’s revenues" - Cost of Goods Sold`
- **Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS)** is the amount that the company **paid** for the goods that it **sold** _over the course of the period_.

Example:
- Laura
  - Bought 100 t-shirts for $12 each.
  - Sold all of those t-shirts for $2,500. _Sales = $2,500_
  - CoGS = $1,200
  - Gross Profit = $1,300
- Rich
  - His costs are all overhead.
    - 'cause he is selling services.
    - which is preparing tax returns.
  - each additional return he prepares adds nothing to his total costs
    - so he has no Cost of Goods Sold
  - His gross profit is simply equal to his revenues.

#### Operating Income vs. Net Income

- Sometimes, you need to separates operating revenues and expenses from non-operating revenues and expenses on income statements.
  - Operating revenues are those coming from the sale of the business’s primary products or services.
  - Operating expenses are the expenses related to the core operation of the business.
- Non-operating revenues and expenses are those that are unrelated to the core operations of the business.
- The point of separating operating revenues and expenses from non-operating revenues and expenses is 
  - to allow for the calculation of operating income.

Query?:
> is retained earnings account equity?

Just to make sure and have fun with ChatGPT guys lol:
> Yes, retained earnings account is a type of equity and is reported in the shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet. Retained earnings are the accumulated portion of a business’s profits that are not distributed as dividends to shareholders but instead are reserved for reinvestment back into the business. Retained earnings can be used to purchase assets or other investments.
