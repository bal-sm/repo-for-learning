> Source: I had to self-teach myself accountancy before I could hire any professionals for my business.
> 
> I've got two major reccs:
> - "Accounting Made Simple" by Mike Piper: Amazing book for the basic concepts, really got me going nicely
> - "Accounting All-in-One For Dummies" by Kenneth Boyd: Part of the classic "For Dummies" series, but despite the title you'll be no dummy once you've read this, really good at covering a wide range of topics

[From](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/xsgqq9/best_books_for_beginners/):
> The books that helped me a ton when starting out were:
> - Solid Footing. I have the 4th edition, but I believe any edition should work.
> - Accounting for Dummies. This one has a ton of good info.
> - Schaum's Principles of Accounting 1. This is like a textbook but it has the answers written in the book.
> 
> If you were to want to dig a little deeper, try also Financial Statements by ittelson. It's a pretty good one that discusses the financial statements, and what the information on them means.

[From](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/s8qcyh/what_are_some_mustread_books_of_accounting_and/):
> "The Smartest Guys in the Room" and "Conspiracy of Fools" Two excellent books on Enron and how they browbeat analysts and their auditors all while abusing the crap out of GAAP to hide their shadiness.
