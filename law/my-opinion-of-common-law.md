I think it's a better law than (I'm sorry but it's the truth though) civil law and after shari'ah law (because ofc Muhammad saw. is my soon-to-be husband :*  ) because with civil law, there will always be discrepancies between the written rule, and the nature (or society (more precisely)) of our everlasting and existing timeline and reality (edan)
