Did you know that crystallization of water can be influenced by echo and sound?
So, if you say "Bismillahirrahmanirrahim" before drinking the water, the crystal will be beautiful and InsyaAllah will bring the best benefits for us.
Might add source later.

PS: don't forget to sit down while drinking water :)
